# Keyboard Shortcuts

Below is an exhaustive list of Keyboard shortcuts in the Symphony editor.

## Gestures
#### **Two-finger Scroll**
Moves the view around the workspace, horizontally and vertically. You can also use the scrub bar at the bottom of the window.
#### **Clicking on a Tile**
Performs the action that is specified in the action type (top right). These include *Brush, Eraser,* and *Select.*
#### **Clicking on a Note (leftmost column)**
Plays the note for a short duration, without affecting the workspace. Useful for hearing notes and testing melodies.
#### **Dragging across Tiles**
In *Select*, shows a simple box window that selects all notes that have any parts sitting within the bounds of the selection. If the drag is done on a selected note or notes, dragging will move that selection rather than spawn a selection window.
#### **Clicking a Top-Bar element**
Can either focus the element or *cycle* the element. For Tempo or Time-interval, clicking places the element in focus so that the user may edit the field. For composition key and musical mode (near top right), channel (near top right), action type (top right), play/pause (top left), accidental (top left), and play head selector (near top left), selecting the element cycles through the states of the button.

## Bindings
#### **Space**
Toggles play / pause.
#### **Arrow Keys**
Substitute for scrolling. Works in all directions.
#### **Ctrl / Cmd**
To make it faster to switch action type, *holding Ctrl / Cmd* switches to *Eraser*, and letting go switches to *Brush*. Thus, tapping Ctrl / Cmd is a quick shorthand to return to Brush.
#### **Ctrl / Cmd + Z, Ctrl / Cmd + Shift + Z**
Undo and redo, respectively.
#### **Ctrl / Cmd + S**
Saves the file. Does not stop auto-save from regularly occuring.
#### **Shift**
This is a quick shorthand to switch the action type to *Select*. Once in *Select*, holding *Shift* while selecting notes allows for multi-select.
#### **Alt + Drag**
This is how you can duplicate a section of music. By holding Alt as you drag, a faint, ghostly version of the selected music is created, becoming solid when you let go at the location where you do so.
#### **Hotbar keys 1-7**
These are shorthands to switch to the respective music channel, to avoid having to cycle through all 7. To duplicate a section of music into a new channel, Alt + Drag the music bit, then press the music channel you want to move it into at the same time.
#### **'<' and '>'**
Extends (>) or retracts (<) all *selected* notes by exactly one tile. This is useful when taking a section and trying to make it "fit" within another, or to induce overlap between notes in a section.
