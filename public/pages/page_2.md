# Get Symphony for macOS

## Step 1 - Download
Go to [symphony.nimbial.com](https://symphony.nimbial.com) and navigate to the **Download** tab.

Press **"Download Symphony for macOS 11+"**

If the platform shown on the button does not match the system you are on, scroll down to **Releases**, and select the latest version for your system.

A .zip file titled **Symphony-vX.X.X-macOS-installer.zip** should begin downloading.

Once the file has finished downloading, unzip the file, preferably in a temporary folder like **Downloads**. Open it once it has been unzipped.

Double-click **Symphony-0.0.0-arm64.dmg**. You should be prompted with a momentary setup wizard. If there are any instructions, follow them, then close the installer. (This should usually involve dragging the Symphony icon into the Applications folder)

Symphony is now installed. You can find it as an app via **Spotlight** or in your App Launcher.
