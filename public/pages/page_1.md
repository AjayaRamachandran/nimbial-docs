# Get Symphony for Windows

## Step 1 - Download
Go to [symphony.nimbial.com](https://symphony.nimbial.com) and navigate to the **Download** tab.

Press **"Download Symphony for Windows 10/11"**

If the platform shown on the button does not match the system you are on, scroll down to **Releases**, and select the latest version for your system.

A .zip file titled **Symphony-vX.X.X-win64-installer.zip** should begin downloading.

Once the file has finished downloading, unzip the file, preferably in a temporary folder like **Downloads**. Open it once it has been unzipped.

Double-click **Symphony Setup 0.0.0.exe**. You should be prompted with a momentary setup wizard. If there are any instructions, follow them, then close the installer.

Symphony is now installed. You can find it as an app via **Search** or on your desktop.
